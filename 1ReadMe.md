## Introduction

This project provides a basic setup for a web page using HTML and CSS. It includes instructions on how to create, link, and run these files.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you will need:

- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++)
- A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Folder Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
project-folder/
│
├── index.html
└── styles/
    └── styles.css
```

## Creating HTML and CSS Files

1. **Create Project Folder**:
   Create a new folder for your project. Inside this folder, create another folder named `styles` to hold your CSS files.

2. **Create HTML File**:
   In the root of your project folder, create a file named `index.html` and add the following basic HTML structure:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Basic HTML and CSS</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is a simple HTML and CSS project.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Create CSS File**:
   In the `styles` folder, create a file named `styles.css` and add the following basic CSS:

   ```css
   body {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       background-color: #f0f0f0;
       color: #333;
       text-align: center;
       padding: 50px;
   }

   h1 {
       color: #007BFF;
   }

   p {
       font-size: 1.2em;
   }
   ```

## Linking HTML and CSS

In the HTML file (`index.html`), link the CSS file using the `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/styles.css">
```

This tells the browser to apply the styles defined in `styles.css` to the HTML elements.

## Running the Project

1. **Open the HTML File**:
   Open `index.html` in your web browser. You can do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" followed by your preferred browser, or by dragging the file into an open browser window.

2. **View the Output**:
   You should see the "Hello, World!" heading and the paragraph styled according to your CSS file.
